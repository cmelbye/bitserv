This will register your current nickname with NickServ.
This will allow you to assert some form of identity on
the network and to be added to access lists. Furthermore,
NickServ will warn users using your nick without
identifying and allow you to kill ghosts.
The password is a case-sensitive password that you make
up. Please write down or memorize your password! You
will need it later to change settings.

Syntax: REGISTER <password> <email-address>

Examples:
    /msg NickServ REGISTER bar foo@bar.com
